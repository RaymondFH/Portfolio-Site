*NEW AI Webapp*

I've created an app powered by Claude that helps one solve their problems using wisdom from the Bible. This app takes your problem (prompt) and searches the Bible and Catholic teachings to recommend jumping-off points for reading scripture. This app does not alter Biblical texts, and simply recommends passages. This is, of course, inspired by TempleOS (RIP Terry).
